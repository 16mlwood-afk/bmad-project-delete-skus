# üö® Critical Bug Fix: FBA Inventory API Response Parsing

## Bug Overview
**Issue**: SKU cleanup tool incorrectly reported 0 FBA inventory units when SKUs actually had active inventory, potentially leading to accidental deletion of SKUs with stock.

**Severity**: CRITICAL - Could cause loss of active inventory listings

**Date Discovered**: October 14, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 14, 2025

## Problem Description

The tool was designed to only delete SKUs that meet two criteria:
1. Age > 30 days
2. Zero FBA inventory (both fulfillable and inbound)

However, a parsing bug in the FBA inventory API response caused the tool to:
- ‚úÖ Correctly retrieve inventory data from Amazon's API
- ‚ùå Incorrectly parse the response structure
- ‚ùå Report 0 units when SKUs had active inventory
- ‚ùå Mark SKUs with inventory as "safe for deletion"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Issue
The Amazon Selling Partner API returns inventory data in a nested structure:
```json
{
  "payload": {
    "granularity": {...},
    "inventorySummaries": [...]
  }
}
```

### Original Code (BUGGY)
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG: Looking for inventorySummaries at wrong level
inventory_summaries = response.get('inventorySummaries', [])
```

### Fixed Code (CORRECT)
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Proper nested response parsing
payload = response.get('payload', {})
inventory_summaries = payload.get('inventorySummaries', [])
```

## Impact Assessment

### Potential Consequences
- **Inventory Loss**: SKUs with active inventory could be deleted
- **Revenue Impact**: Loss of sellable products
- **Account Issues**: Potential Amazon policy violations
- **Data Inaccuracy**: Tool reports unreliable for decision making

### Actual Risk
- **High Risk**: Bug existed in production code
- **Undetected**: No visible symptoms in dry-run mode
- **Real Impact**: Could affect live inventory management

## Fix Details

### Files Modified
- `sku-cleanup-tool/amazon_api.py` - Enhanced FBA inventory check method

### Changes Made
1. **Corrected Response Parsing**: Fixed nested payload structure access
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed debugging for troubleshooting
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better fallback for missing data

### Validation
- ‚úÖ **Tested with Known Inventory**: SKU `a.it_149.99_10__1079_117_UKCB` (10 units)
- ‚úÖ **Verified Detection**: Tool now correctly shows "HAS INVENTORY (F: 10, I: 0)"
- ‚úÖ **Confirmed Protection**: SKU correctly marked as ineligible for deletion

## Testing & Validation

### Before Fix
```bash
# Showed: FBA Check - Fulfillable: 0, Inbound: 0, Status: SAFE
# Reality: 10 units in stock
```

### After Fix
```bash
# Shows: FBA Check - Fulfillable: 10, Inbound: 0, Status: HAS INVENTORY
# Correctly protects SKU from deletion
```

### Test Commands Used
```bash
# Specific SKU test
TEST_MODE=true TEST_SEED_SKUS=a.it_149.99_10__1079_117_UKCB DRY_RUN=true python3 main.py

# Batch test to verify overall functionality
TEST_MODE=true TEST_SAMPLE_SIZE=20 DRY_RUN=true python3 main.py
```

## Prevention Measures

### Code Review Checklist
- ‚úÖ Verify API response structure matches documentation
- ‚úÖ Test with real data containing inventory
- ‚úÖ Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Include fallback mechanisms for missing fields

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Mock API responses with different inventory levels
2. **Integration Tests**: Test with real SKUs having various inventory states
3. **Regression Tests**: Ensure fix doesn't break existing functionality

## API Response Structure Reference

### Correct Structure (Amazon SP-API)
```json
{
  "payload": {
    "granularity": {
      "granularityType": "Marketplace",
      "granularityId": "A1F83G8C2ARO7P"
    },
    "inventorySummaries": [
      {
        "sellerSku": "SKU123",
        "inventoryDetails": {
          "fulfillableQuantity": 10,
          "inboundWorkingQuantity": 0,
          "inboundShippedQuantity": 0,
          "inboundReceivingQuantity": 0
        },
        "totalQuantity": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Key Points
- **Nested Structure**: All data under `payload` object
- **Detailed Inventory**: Available when `details=true` parameter used
- **Array Format**: `inventorySummaries` is an array of SKU data

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Post-Fix Monitoring
- Monitor for inventory-related errors in logs
- Track deletion attempts vs successful deletions
- Alert on any SKUs deleted with non-zero inventory

### Health Checks
- Regular validation of FBA inventory API responses
- Automated tests with mock inventory data
- Integration tests with real inventory scenarios

## Conclusion

This was a **critical safety bug** that could have caused significant inventory loss. The fix ensures the tool correctly identifies and protects SKUs with active inventory, maintaining the core safety principle of only deleting SKUs with zero inventory.

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Tool now correctly handles FBA inventory verification
